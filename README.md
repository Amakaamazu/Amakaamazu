## Featured Projects 💻

### Pac-Man Game

**Pac-Man Game** is a Python implementation of the classic arcade game using **Pygame**. This project demonstrates my ability to **design and implement game mechanics, AI-controlled ghost behavior, collision detection, scoring systems, and interactive sound effects**. It showcases skills in **Python OOP, Pygame development, and retro-style game design**. You can check out the repository [here](https://github.com/Amakaamazu/PacMan-Game).

### Secure Digital Wallet Simulation
**Secure Digital Wallet Simulation** is a Python fintech project that replicates the core security architecture of a digital payment wallet, similar conceptually to PayPal or M-Pesa. Built with **Python, SQLite, and the cryptography library**, this project demonstrates my ability to **design secure registration and login systems, hash passwords using PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256, encrypt sensitive user data at rest with Fernet AES, enforce atomic transactions to guarantee fund integrity, implement brute-force lockout after repeated failed login attempts, flag suspicious high-value transfers, and maintain a complete transaction audit trail**. It showcases skills in **Python backend engineering, applied cryptography, fintech security design, and database-driven application development**. You can check out the repository [here](https://github.com/Amakaamazu/secure-digital-wallet).

### Crypto Portfolio Risk Analyzer

**Crypto Portfolio Risk Analyzer** is a Python tool that fetches 1 year of cryptocurrency price data and computes key financial risk metrics including volatility, annualized returns, and the Sharpe Ratio. Built with **Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib**, this project demonstrates my ability to **analyze financial data, generate risk reports, and visualize crypto market performance**. You can check out the repository [here](https://github.com/Amakaamazu/crypto-portfolio-risk-analyzer).

### FinTech Fraud Detection System
**FinTech Fraud Detection System** is an end-to-end machine learning pipeline that detects fraudulent credit card transactions using the Kaggle credit card fraud dataset. Built with **Python, scikit-learn, and imbalanced-learn**. This project demonstrates my ability to **engineer features from financial data, address severe class imbalance (0.17% fraud rate) with SMOTE, train and evaluate multiple ML models, and visualise results through confusion matrices and ROC curves**. You can check out the repository [here](https://github.com/Amakaamazu/fintech-fraud-detection).

### Financial OSINT Risk Monitor
**Financial OSINT Risk Monitor** is a Python fintech tool that simulates an open-source intelligence (OSINT) pipeline for monitoring the reputational risk of public companies in real time. Built with **Python, NewsAPI, NLTK VADER, and Matplotlib**, this project demonstrates my ability to **fetch and process live news headlines via REST APIs, perform NLP-based sentiment analysis, classify coverage as positive, neutral, or negative, compute a weighted Reputational Risk Score, and visualise sentiment distribution through dual-panel charts**. It showcases skills in **Python modular design, applied NLP, financial risk analysis, secure API key management, and data visualisation for stakeholder reporting**. You can check out the repository [here](https://github.com/Amakaamazu/financial-osint-risk-monitor).

### Smart Contract Vulnerability Analysis


**Smart Contract Vulnerability Analysis** is a tool developed to identify common vulnerabilities in Ethereum smart contracts. Built with **Solidity and Python**. This project demonstrates my ability to **interact with smart contracts, analyze their code, and flag known issues**. You can check out the repository [here](https://github.com/Amakaamazu/smart-contract-vulnerability-analysis).

### Vulnerability Scanner


**Vulnerability Scanner** is a Python tool designed to scan websites for common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, or open ports. Built using **Python, networking, and web vulnerability libraries**. This project showcases my skills in **detecting and addressing potential security threats in web applications**. You can check out the repository [here](https://github.com/Amakaamazu/vulnerability-scanner).
