### Secure Digital Wallet Simulation
**Secure Digital Wallet Simulation** is a Python fintech project that replicates the core security architecture of a digital payment wallet, similar conceptually to PayPal or M-Pesa. Built with **Python, SQLite, and the cryptography library**, this project demonstrates my ability to **design secure registration and login systems, hash passwords using PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256, encrypt sensitive user data at rest with Fernet AES, enforce atomic transactions to guarantee fund integrity, implement brute-force lockout after repeated failed login attempts, flag suspicious high-value transfers, and maintain a complete transaction audit trail**. It showcases skills in **Python backend engineering, applied cryptography, fintech security design, and database-driven application development**. You can check out the repository [here](https://github.com/Amakaamazu/secure-digital-wallet).

### SafeSpace Digital Safety Checker
**SafeSpace Digital Safety Checker** is a Python GUI application designed to help users understand and evaluate their public digital exposure using open-source intelligence (OSINT) techniques. Built with **Python, Tkinter, and REST API integration**, this project demonstrates my ability to design user-facing security tools that combine technical analysis with human-centered cybersecurity awareness.

The application allows users to input an email address and username, checks for exposure in public data breaches, analyzes username reuse across major platforms, calculates a Digital Exposure Score, and provides personalized safety recommendations. The system includes a color-coded risk indicator and a structured recommendation engine to translate technical findings into practical guidance.

This project showcases skills in **API integration, OSINT techniques, GUI development, risk scoring logic, modular Python architecture, and applied cybersecurity education**. It reflects my interest in building secure systems that protect users and promote responsible digital behavior.
